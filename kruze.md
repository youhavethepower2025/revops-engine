## COMPENSATION JUSTIFICATION

### Market Comparables:
- **Anthropic Member of Technical Staff:** $474K median total comp
- **Anthropic Senior Engineers:** Up to $671K total comp
- **OpenAI L5 (Senior):** $1.06M total comp
- **OpenAI L6 (Staff/Principal):** $1.27M total comp

### Why $400K-$700K Range Is Appropriate:

**Technical Scarcity:**
- MCP production experience: <500 people globally
- + Cross-domain communication: <100 of those
- + Business context: <25 of those
- + Available for hire: <10 of those
- **= Top 10 globally in this specific profile**

**Demonstrated Capabilities:**
- Builds production systems (not just demos)
- Ships fast (weekend → production)
- Thinks architecturally (multi-tenant, edge economics)
- Communicates clearly (technical → business → executive)
- Self-directed (no hand-holding needed)

**Value Delivery:**
- **Day 1:** Can review and improve existing agent architectures
- **Week 1:** Can design new MCP implementations
- **Month 1:** Can lead team on agent platform development
- **Month 3:** Can represent company publicly on MCP/agents
- **Month 6:** Can drive strategic direction for AI orchestration

## WHAT JOHN DOES NOT WANT

### Roles to Avoid:
- ❌ **Traditional Software Engineer** (code monkey work, no architecture)
- ❌ **Data Scientist** (statistics heavy, not orchestration)
- ❌ **ML Researcher** (academic, requires PhD)
- ❌ **Pure Backend Engineer** (debugging production bugs all day)
- ❌ **Consulting/Services** (RevOps as a service, client work)

### Work Environments to Avoid:
- ❌ **In-office required** (remote or hybrid only, 3 days/week max)
- ❌ **US-only location** (wants option to work from LATAM)
- ❌ **Slow-moving enterprise** (needs fast iteration culture)
- ❌ **Non-AI companies** (wants frontier AI work, not "AI team" at legacy corp)

---

## WHAT JOHN WANTS

### Ideal Role Characteristics:
- ✅ **Architect agent systems** (design, don't implement every detail)
- ✅ **Build cool AI orchestration** (frontier problems, novel solutions)
- ✅ **Cross-functional communication** (bridge technical and business)
- ✅ **Autonomous execution** (give me the problem, I'll figure it out)
- ✅ **Fast-moving team** (ship weekly, iterate constantly)
- ✅ **Remote-friendly** (LATAM options preferred)

### Dream Companies (Tier 1):
1. **Anthropic** - MCP creators, Claude 3-year relationship, cultural fit on safety/thoughtfulness
2. **xAI** - Grok needs orchestration, Elon velocity, massive upside potential

### Strong Interest (Tier 2):
- **OpenAI** - Leading AI, needs agent infrastructure
- **Cloudflare** - Already building on their stack, Workers AI growth
- **Replit** - AI IDE, MCP early adopter
- **Cursor** - AI coding tools, rapid growth
- **Modal** - Serverless AI compute

### Open To (Tier 3):
- Well-funded AI infrastructure startups ($20M+ Series A/B)
- Companies building developer tools for AI
- Platforms enabling agent ecosystems

---

## KEY TALKING POINTS

### Opening Hook:
"I built production AI orchestration infrastructure in 18 months—from terminal-first-opened to 3 live deployments with 13+ days uptime. I'm one of the first MCP implementation cohort. I'm exploring $400K-$600K roles at companies building agent platforms."

### The Journey (Condensed):
- **Jan 2023:** Chose AI after breakup, saw organizational intelligence trends
- **Jul 2024:** Make.com automation course (16 months ago)
- **Nov 2024:** MCP launch → immediate adoption and implementation
- **Mar 2025:** Claude Code day 1 adoption, Gemini CLI immediately
- **Nov 2025:** 3 production systems, 51 MCP tools, multiple live URLs

### The Transformation Demo:
"Watch me transform a RevOps system I built in a weekend into a job search engine. You'll see my orchestration approach, architectural decisions, and velocity in real-time."

### Why This Candidate Is Rare:
"Most engineers can write code. Few can orchestrate AI systems in production. Almost none can do it AND explain it clearly to non-technical stakeholders. I do both."

### Compensation Anchor:
"Based on market comps—Anthropic at $474K-$671K, OpenAI L5/L6 at $1M+—and considering I'm in the first MCP cohort with production systems, I'm targeting $400K-$600K base, open to higher with equity."

### What John Is Still Learning:
- Advanced observability/monitoring (no production monitoring yet)
- Kubernetes (only Docker Compose experience)
- Large-scale testing (limited test coverage currently)
- Vector databases (chose not to use, but open to learning)

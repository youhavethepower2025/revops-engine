### POST-DEMO AMMUNITION

Have Rebecca ready to say:

- "Every client who sees this wants it immediately"
- "We're only taking 10 partners for the white label program"
- "The recurring revenue potential is massive"

### SUCCESS METRICS

✅ Adrian calls the AI and has smooth conversation
✅ Email arrives before Rebecca finishes explaining pricing
✅ Adrian says some version of "bloody hell" or "brilliant"
✅ Rebecca hears: "How fast can we roll this out?"
✅ Discussion shifts to how much they can charge their clients
✅ Check #2 gets discussed seriously

### THE REAL SECRET:

Adrian doesn't need to understand the tech. He needs to FEEL the magic. When that email hits while they're still talking about the call, when he sees how professional it looks, when he imagines his clients getting this - that's when the check gets written.

Make the tech invisible. Make the value obvious. Make the money multiply in his mind.

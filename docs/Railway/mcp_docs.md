# Railway MCP Documentation

This document provides a summary of the Railway Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server.

## Overview

The Railway MCP Server enables AI applications to interact with your Railway projects and infrastructure using natural language. It acts as a bridge, translating natural language requests into executable commands for the Railway Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Key Concepts

*   **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: A standard for how AI applications (hosts) interact with external tools and data sources.
*   **Railway MCP Server**: The server that exposes tools and workflows for managing Railway systems.
*   **Tools**: Executable functions an AI agent can invoke (e.g., `deploy-template`, `get-logs`).
*   **Resources**: Data sources providing contextual information to the AI (e.g., a list of available projects).
*   **Prompts**: Reusable templates to guide the AI on how to use its tools effectively.

## Getting Started

To use the Railway MCP Server, you typically need:

1.  An active Railway account.
2.  A Railway API token.
3.  The Railway CLI installed and authenticated.

## Further Reading

For more detailed documentation and installation instructions, you can refer to the official Railway Docs on the MCP Server.

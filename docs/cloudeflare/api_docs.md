# Cloudflare API Documentation

This document provides a summary of the Cloudflare API, based on the official documentation.

## Overview

The Cloudflare API is a RESTful API that allows you to programmatically manage your Cloudflare account and services. It uses HTTPS requests and returns JSON responses.

## Authentication

Authentication is done via API tokens, which are recommended over API keys for better security. You can create API tokens from your Cloudflare dashboard under "My Profile" → "API Tokens".

execution is tracked. No more black box anxiety about what AI is doing in our systems."

## FAQ Copy (Pull from Prompt Logic)

### "How is this different from ChatGPT?"
```
ChatGPT doesn't know your tools or your business context. Every conversation starts from zero.

Spectrum is connected to your CRM, your call history, your project management tools -
whatever systems matter to YOUR company. Plus, you own the conversation data and can see
exactly how your team is using AI.

When someone leaves your company, their AI knowledge doesn't walk out the door with them -
it stays in Spectrum.
```

### "How is this different from automation platforms?"
```
Spectrum is actual AI with reasoning, not if-then workflows dressed up as intelligence.

It understands context, handles exceptions, and adapts to how you communicate. You talk
naturally, Spectrum handles the complexity. Plus, it learns from every conversation and
makes that knowledge available to your entire team.
```

### "How is this different from Microsoft Copilot?"
```
With Copilot, your data feeds Microsoft's ecosystem. With Spectrum, your data stays yours.
You control what it learns, you own the infrastructure, and there's no vendor lock-in.

Copilot works with Microsoft tools. Spectrum works with ANY tools - your CRM, your
automation platforms, your custom APIs, whatever your business runs on.
```

### "What if someone leaves our company?"
```
That's exactly the problem Spectrum solves.

With traditional AI training, the knowledge walks out the door with the employee. With
Spectrum, the organizational intelligence stays. New hires inherit an AI that already knows
your systems, your processes, your business context.

Onboarding becomes "talk to Spectrum" instead of reading 50 SOPs.

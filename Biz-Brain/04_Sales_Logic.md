# 04 SALES LOGIC

## 1. THE "AGENCY KILL SHOT"
**The Context:** Most agencies are reselling GoHighLevel (GHL) sub-accounts and marking up the SaaS fees. They trap the client's data in *their* ecosystem.
**The Question:** When a prospect says "My agency handles that," you ask one question:
> *"Do you have the API Keys to your own data, or do you have to ask them for permission to see your own customer list?"*
**The Pivot:**
* If they say "I don't know": They are a tenant, not an owner.
* **The Pitch:** "Right now, you are renting your business from your agency. We build the infrastructure so you *own* the brain, and the agency just works for *you*."

## 2. THE "FIRST VICTORY" (The Hook)
**We do not sell "Time Savings" (too abstract). We sell "Optics" (The Truth).**
* **The Problem:** The business owner has 5 tabs open (Stripe, GHL, Bank, Email) and is mentally doing the math to see if they are profitable.
* **The Victory:** The "Morning Briefing."
* **The Deliverable:** A single command in Claude: *"Run the Morning Brief."*
    * *Agent Action:* Queries Stripe (Revenue), GHL (Leads), and Bank (Cash).
    * *Result:* A plain-text summary of the *actual* health of the business, bypassing the "vanity metrics" on the agency dashboards.
* **Why it Sells:** It’s an immediate dopamine hit of *control*.

## 3. THE "NO" LIST (Disqualification Criteria)
We disqualify ruthlessly to protect our margins and sanity.

| Trigger | The Rejection Script | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Can we use ChatGPT?"** | "No. OpenAI's architecture requires sending your data to their public cloud actions. We use Claude because it allows for a secure, encrypted tunnel directly to your data without exposing it to the public web." | **Technical Friction:** OpenAI "Actions" are clunky; Claude Native MCP is seamless. |
| **"Fix my CRM."** | "We are Architects, not Janitors. We connect the pipes; we don't clean the water. You need to hire a VA to clean your data first." | **Profit Killer:** Data cleaning is a bottomless pit of low-value hours. |
| **"Can you guarantee sales?"** | "No. We build the engine; you drive the car. If you put bad gas (bad offer) in a Ferrari, it still won't win the race." | **Liability:** Never take responsibility for their business outcomes, only system uptime. |

## 4. THE "AGENCY WHALE" STRATEGY (The GHL Pivot)
**The Insight:** Smart Agency Owners are a *channel partner*, not just clients.
* **The Pitch to Agencies:** "You are currently manually managing 50 sub-accounts. I can build you a 'Super Admin' brain that lets you audit all 50 clients in natural language."
* **The Upsell:** "I will white-label this infrastructure for you. You sell it to your clients for $500/mo, pay me $200/mo for the license."

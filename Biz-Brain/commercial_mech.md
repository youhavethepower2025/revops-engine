# 01 COMMERCIAL MECHANICS

## THE "NO TRAPPED EMPLOYEE" DOCTRINE
We operate as High-Value Architects, not hourly employees.
* **We Build Infrastructure:** We deliver a functioning system.
* **We Maintain Uptime:** We ensure the system keeps running.
* **We Do Not Ghost-Operate:** We do not run the client's business, clean their data, or attend their internal meetings.

## THE PRICING MATRIX

### Variable 1: Infrastructure (The "Brain")
*Defined by User Count & Complexity.*

| Tier | Target | Setup Fee (One-Time) | Monthly Retainer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1: Founder's Remote** | Solo Operator | **$10,000 - $15,000** | **$1,500 / mo** |
| **Tier 2: Team Cortex** | Multi-User / Complex Data | **$20,000 - $30,000** | **$3,500 - $5,000 / mo** |

### Variable 2: Advisory (The "Fractional Officer")
*Defined by Access to You.*

| Level | Access | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard** | **Async Only.** Email/Chat support for technical issues. No scheduled meetings. | **Included in Retainer** |
| **Strategic** | **Fractional CAIO.** Weekly sync (45 min), strategy direction, workflow auditing. | **+$7,500 / mo (Minimum)** |

## SCOPE OF RETAINER (The Sanity Line)

**✅ INCLUDED (Maintenance)**
* **API Updates:** Stripe changes their API v2 -> v3? We fix it.
* **Uptime Monitoring:** The container crashes? We restart it.
* **Token Management:** Auth tokens expire? We refresh them.
* **Critical Bug Fixes:** The agent fails to execute a standard prompt? We debug it.

**❌ EXCLUDED (Expansion - Billed Separately)**
* **New Integrations:** "Can we add Calendly?" -> **New Project Fee (e.g., $2,500).**
* **New Workflows:** "Can you teach it to do Sales Outreach?" -> **New Project Fee.**
* **Data Cleaning:** "My CRM is messy." -> **Client Responsibility.**
* **General Tech Support:** "My printer isn't working." -> **Not our problem.**

## TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT (The "Teeth")

### 1. The MSP Model (Ownership)
* **Infrastructure:** We own the Docker Image, the MCP Server Code, and the Deployment Architecture.
* **Data:** Client owns their Data (Database Volume) and API Keys.
* **The License:** The Client is granted a **License to Access** the infrastructure contingent on the Monthly Retainer. They do not own the source code.
* **Buyout:** Buyouts are generally **NOT** available. The system requires our specialized maintenance. (Exceptions negotiated at >10x ARR).

### 2. Payment Structure
* **Setup Fee:**
    * **50% Deposit:** Required to schedule the build week.
    * **50% Completion:** Due upon "Go-Live" (Handover of access).
* **Recurring Retainer:**
    * **Pre-Paid:** Invoiced on the 25th, **Due on the 1st.**
    * **Late Policy:** Service paused if payment is not received by the 5th.

### 3. The Kill Switch
* If the Retainer is unpaid, the Docker Container is **Paused**.
* **Result:** The "Brain" stops responding. The Client's data remains safe on their volume, but the intelligence layer goes offline immediately.
* **Restoration:** Requires payment of outstanding balance + Reactivation Fee.
